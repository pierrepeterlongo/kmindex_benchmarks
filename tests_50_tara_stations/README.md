This directory synthetises command lines and data sources of the experiments proposed in the manuscript. There are three main notes
* [versions_and_commands_benchmark.md](versions_and_commands_benchmark.md) describes the versions of the tested tools and the commands used to build indexes and perform queries on the 50 TARA stations dataset. This file synthetizes the time, RAM, and disk space used by each tool.
* [versions_and_commands_benchmark_for_sampled_methods.md](versions_and_commands_benchmark_for_sampled_methods.md) provides the same information for two sampling-based indexing tools, not included in the main kmindex. These tools are Needle and PebbleScout.
* [check_fp_rates.md](check_fp_rates.md) describes the computation of false negatives rates of the tested tools which were able to build an index and perform queries on the 50 TARA stations dataset: kmindex and MetaProfi.
